            <p> For this performance you will need a stable connection to the internet and the ability to submit text input. </p>
            <p> You do not need a camera or microphone and will not be seen or heard on screen. </p>
            <p> The purpose of Litmus is to create a space for genuine connection between performers and 
                audiences in a historical period defined by isolation and tumult. </p>
            <p> Each iteration of Litmus accommodates 1 participant via this portal, however each iteration 
                is livestreamed to our YouTube Live account to increase access to the performance and to raise 
                money to support accessible arts programming in southern California. </p>
                <p> Litmus asks that patrons create an account via Eventbrite in order to access the performance.

                you based on your input. This information will only be seen by the performer and will not be 
                shared on the YouTube Live stream or with any third party. The performer will make reference
